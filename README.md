# NFT-Landing.
NFT-Landing - a webpage created for my portfolio. 
A distinctive feature here is a new module for animation when scrolling.

<!-- Ctrl + Shift + V => view this file in VS Code -->

Updated the script for animations. 
New: 
- New syntax, easy to understand. Hints are left, you just need to hover the cursor over the property.
- You can set animation properties for several elements at once (and even for several selectors).
